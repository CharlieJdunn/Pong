## Pong

This is my Pong game, the goal of the game is to destory all blocks whilst not letting the ball pass the paddle. The game ends when all blocks are destroyed or when all lives are lost. Pong was created using HTML and Javascript.

##Motivation

I created this game to further my Javascript knowledge and to start a portfolio.

##Build

To build this you will need a web browser. When the file is downloaded, unzip the folder and then run the solution.
